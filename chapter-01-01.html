      <h2>Chapter 1- The Parking Lot</h2>

      <p>
        </p>
<p>
Morgan hadn’t planned on spending her lunch break in the Pep Boys parking lot cussing at a pair of windshield wipers, but here she was. One foot on the curb, sleeves shoved up, hair already losing its fight with the humidity. The asphalt shimmered in the heat, bending the edges of the lot. The air tasted faintly of rubber and oil, the kind that clung to the back of your throat.
</p><p>
If anyone had walked by five minutes ago, they would’ve heard a tone that would’ve shocked her law professors.</p><p>

“Why—”</p><p>

She shoved the blade again.</p><p>

“Won’t—”</p><p>

Another push.</p><p>

“You—”</p><p>

The arm rattled.</p><p>

“Snap. In.”</p><p>
<p>
Each word came with a shove. The plastic bit into her thumb. The metal arm rattled through her wrist, vibrating like it had no intention of cooperating. Sweat slid between her shoulder blades, dampening her blouse until it clung in places she didn’t appreciate.</p><p>

She tugged again. The wiper arm popped loose, swung back, and smacked the windshield.

Morgan closed her eyes.

Slow inhale. Slow exhale.</p><p>
<p>
You are a mature adult, she reminded herself. You handle depositions and mediations. She leaned closer and whispered, “You will not be defeated by a piece of plastic.”
</p><p>
The universe, apparently amused, chose that moment to introduce a new sound. An engine rolled into the lot — not the polite hum of a sedan, but something lower, steadier. The sound cut through the heat, close enough to feel underfoot before she fully registered it.
</p><p>
Great. Just what she needed. An audience.
</p><p>
A blacked-out motorcycle rolled into the space beside her without asking permission. Loud pipes. The kind that announced themselves before you had time to decide whether you wanted the attention. Matte helmet. Broad shoulders. Boots scarred enough to suggest they’d seen more than pavement.

The engine cut. The silence that followed wasn’t empty — it felt loaded.</p><p>

Morgan froze, one hand still gripping the wiper arm. She clocked him the way women learned to do without realizing when they’d learned it. Distance. Angle. Exit.</p><p>

He swung off the bike with easy confidence and lifted his helmet. Dark hair spilled loose, brushing his shoulders. He was bigger than she’d expected — not bulky, but solid, like someone who knew how to use his weight if he had to. The leather jacket looked worn for function, not fashion. His forearms were bare, marked by old scrapes and sun, the kind you got from fixing things that didn’t come with instructions.</p><p>

He glanced at her car, then the wiper, then her expression — and something in his face shifted. Not interest. Assessment. Then a flicker of amusement.
</p><p>
“You know,” he said, voice calm, almost mild, “that thing’s winning.” </p><p>The tension loosened just a notch. Not gone. But redirected.
</p><p>
Morgan pretended not to notice him — which might’ve worked if she hadn’t been staring a moment earlier — and muttered something under her breath that sounded like an argument she was losing.
</p><p>
He didn’t crowd her. Didn’t touch the car. Just leaned back against the bike, hands loose at his sides, watching like this was a problem he’d seen before and knew how to wait out. And somehow — annoyingly — that made him feel less like a threat and more like a complication.
</p><p>
He glanced at her. Took in the half-installed wiper blade, her stubborn stance, the way she muttered under her breath like the car could hear her.
</p><p>
“You know,” he said, voice easy, edged with amusement, “those things usually respond better to persuasion than combat.”
</p><p>
She shot him a look. “I’m persuading. You should’ve seen the combat.”
</p><p>
A smile tugged at one corner of his mouth. Not smug. Just entertained. “Want a hand?” Her pride almost said no. Her blood pressure said yes.
</p><p>
She exhaled. “Sure. Before I file a lawsuit against windshield manufacturers everywhere.” “I’ll testify,” he said, stepping closer. “On your behalf.”
</p><p>
She handed him the blade like she was surrendering a weapon. He glanced at it, adjusted the angle, and pressed once — firm, confident.
</p><p>
Click.
</p><p>
Installed.
</p><p>
Morgan blinked. “Seriously?”
</p><p>
He held up his empty hand. “Ancient motorcycle mechanic magic. Passed down through generations.”
</p><p>
She snorted before she could stop herself. “Yeah. That tracks.”
</p><p>
He gave a small, exaggerated bow. “Quinn.”
</p><p>
“Morgan.”
</p><p>
They shook hands. His grip was steady. Hers tried to pretend she hadn’t just been swearing at car parts for ten straight minutes.
</p><p>
“So,” Quinn said, stepping back, “you always pick fights with auto parts, or is this a special occasion?” “It’s a new hobby,” she deadpanned. “Thinking about turning professional.”
</p><p>
He laughed — quiet, real. “Let me know if you need a sponsor.” She tugged her sleeve down. “Thanks. Seriously. I should probably hire a pit crew next time I attempt basic maintenance.”
</p><p>
“Happy to help.” They stood there a moment, the easy kind of pause. Slightly turning his head, he glanced toward the store. “Here for oil,” he said. “Bike drinks the good stuff.”
</p><p>
“Motorcycle owner and puzzle-master,” she replied. “Impressive.”
</p><p>
“What about you?” he asked. “Mechanic by choice or desperate circumstance?” “I’m in law.”
</p><p>
She smoothed her hair, suddenly aware it might look like she’d stuck her head out a moving window.
</p><p>
His eyebrows lifted slightly. “Law, huh? Must be interesting.” “Some days,” she said, which was the safest answer possible.
</p><p>
“What kind of law?”
</p><p>
She hesitated, then shrugged. “The grown-up kind. Lots of reading. Very little glory.”
</p><p>
“Sounds thrilling.”
</p><p>
“And you?” she asked. “What do you do? Aside from saving stranded drivers from wiper-related breakdowns.”
</p><p>
“A little company,” he said easily. “Tech stuff.” That explained nothing. He didn’t seem inclined to explain more.
</p><p>
He reached into his jacket and pulled out a card. Matte black. Simple. He handed it to her without ceremony. “They might be looking for some legal help,” he said. “If you’re interested.”
</p><p>
She took it. It felt heavier than she expected. She slipped it into her bag without looking at it, not entirely sure why she felt the need to do that. “Thanks,” she said. “I’ll check it out.”
</p><p>
“If you want.” He said it like it truly didn’t matter.
</p><p>
To her, he looked like someone who worked with his hands. Mechanic, maybe. Definitely not suit-and-tie territory. “Well,” she said, opening her car door, “I should get back before my lunch break turns into an unpaid internship in this parking lot.”
</p><p>
“Fair enough.”
</p><p>
“Thanks again.”
</p><p>
He gave a two-finger salute and headed toward the store, unhurried. As he walked away, something tugged at her attention — the sense that he’d taken in more than he needed to. Morgan slid into the driver’s seat and shut the door. The AC blasted to life, cool air washing over her flushed skin. She laughed softly to herself.
</p><p>
“Little company,” she murmured. “Sure.” Through the windshield, she watched Quinn disappear inside, moving like a man with nowhere he needed to rush and nothing he needed to prove. She didn’t know yet that tomorrow’s call would set everything into motion. Right now, all she knew was that her wipers finally worked. And that maybe — just maybe — her day had gotten a little more interesting.
