      <h2>Chapter 1 - The Parking Lot</h2>

      <p>
       Chapter One — The Parking Lot

Morgan hadn’t planned on spending her lunch break in the Pep Boys parking lot cussing at a pair of windshield wipers, but here she was. One foot on the curb, hair frizzed by humidity, sleeves pushed up like she was about to wrestle the car instead of replace a simple strip of rubber.
If anyone had walked by five minutes ago, they would’ve heard a string of words that would’ve shocked her law professors.
“Why. Won’t. You. Snap. In.”
Each word punctuated by a shove and a glare capable of melting steel.
She tugged again. The wiper arm popped loose, swung back, and smacked the windshield.
Morgan closed her eyes and breathed through it. Slow inhale. Slow exhale. You are a mature adult. You handle depositions and mediations.
She whispered, “You will not be defeated by a piece of plastic.”
The universe, apparently amused, chose that moment to introduce new noise: the low growl of an engine turning into the lot. Not a polite sedan hum — a deep, unapologetic rumble that vibrated through the pavement. The kind of sound you could feel in your ribs.
Great. Just what she needed. An audience.
A blacked-out motorcycle pulled into the spot next to her. Loud pipes, matte helmet, boots that had seen road and dust and probably fights with asphalt. He killed the engine, and silence returned — except it wasn’t silence. Adrenaline had a hum.
The rider swung off, pulled off his helmet, and shook out dark hair just long enough to drape over his shoulders. Rough-around-the-edges wasn’t a fair description. It was a starting point. Leather jacket, worn jeans, forearms that looked like they’d won arguments with machinery.
Morgan pretended not to notice him, which was impressive considering she was staring directly at him two seconds ago.
He glanced her way. Paused. Took in the half-installed wiper blade, the stubborn stance, the muttered threats under her breath.
“You know,” he said, voice warm with amusement, “those things usually respond better to persuasion than combat.”
She shot him a look. “I’m persuading. You should’ve seen the combat.”
A smile tugged at one corner of his mouth. Not cocky. Not pitying. Just entertained.
“Want a hand?”
Her pride almost said no. Her blood pressure said yes.
She exhaled. “Sure. Before I file a lawsuit against windshield manufacturers everywhere.”
He stepped closer. “I’ll testify on your behalf.”
Morgan handed him the blade like she was surrendering a weapon. He examined the hinge, lined up the hook, gave it a clean, confident press — and click. Installed.
She blinked. “Seriously?”
He held up the empty palm that wasn’t holding the discarded packaging. “Ancient motorcycle mechanic magic. Passed down through generations.”
She snorted before she could stop herself. “Yeah. That tracks.”
He gave a small half-bow. “Quinn.”
“Morgan.”
They shook hands. His grip was firm, steady. Hers tried to pretend she hadn’t just been swearing at car parts for ten minutes.
“So,” Quinn said, stepping back, “you always pick fights with auto parts or is this a special occasion?”
“It’s a new hobby,” she deadpanned. “Thinking about turning professional.”
He laughed, quiet but real. “Let me know if you need a sponsor.”
She tugged her sleeve down. “Thanks. Seriously. I should probably hire a pit crew next time I attempt basic maintenance.”
“Happy to help.”
Small pause. The easy kind. He glanced toward the store.
“Here for oil. Bike drinks the good stuff.”
“Motorcycle owner and puzzle-master,” she said. “Impressive.”
“What about you? Mechanic by choice or desperate circumstance?”
“I’m in law,” she replied, smoothing hair she suddenly realized might look like she'd crawled out of a wind tunnel.
His eyebrows lifted slightly. “Law, huh? Must be interesting.”
“Some days,” she said, which was the safest answer possible.
“What kind of law?”
She hesitated, then shrugged. “The grown-up kind where you spend most of your time reading things that make your soul fall asleep.”
That earned another smile. “Sounds thrilling.”
“And you?” she asked. “What do you do? Aside from saving stranded drivers from wiper-related breakdowns.”
“A little company,” he said casually. “Nothing exciting. Tech stuff.”
That explained nothing. He didn’t elaborate. Didn’t seem to feel like he needed to.
He reached into his jacket and pulled out a card — simple matte black, understated logo, embossed text. He handed it to her like people did in movies when handing over keys to a kingdom. "They might be looking for some legal help, give them a call." She barely glanced at it. “Thanks. I’ll check it out.”
He nodded like it didn’t matter either way. “If you want.”
To her, he looked like he worked in a shop sharpening knives between road trips. Janitor, maybe. Mechanic. Definitely not suit-and-tie territory.
She tucked the card in her bag without reading it, already convinced it was a hobby side gig.
“Well,” she said, “I should get back before my lunch break turns into an unpaid internship in the Pep Boys parking lot.”
“Fair enough.”
“Thanks again.”
He gave a small salute with two fingers and turned toward the entrance.
Morgan got into her car, exhaling as she closed the door. The AC blasted, cooling her flushed cheeks. She shook her head, laughing to herself.
“Little company,” she mimicked under her breath. “Sure. Bet he cleans the floors at this one too.”
Then again… maybe she’d call the number tomorrow. Just curiosity. Nothing else.
Through the windshield, she watched Quinn walk toward the store — quiet, unhurried, like a man with nowhere he needed to be and nothing to prove.
She didn’t know yet that tomorrow’s call would set everything into motion.
Right now, all she knew was that her wipers finally worked.
And that maybe — just maybe — her day had gotten a little more interesting.
